Computer craft lock is a simple lua program that add two factors authentication to your computer.

To install the program, you can use the following command in your computer:

```wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9551-Dev/cc-lock/main/cc-lock/installer.lua```

To register your account, go to your root folder (`cd /`) and run the following command:

```register```

You can register your account, and enable two factors authentication if your want.

When this is done, you can reboot the computer and see the lock in action.

:warning: Two factors authentication needs an external app running on a device like a phone to work properly.
